You can stake your CRO tokens on any validator nodes, and in return collect a 20% APR of returns from the blockchain.</p></li><li><p><em>Do you make any money out of this?</em></p><p>Nope! The commission rate of this server is permanently set to <strong>0%</strong>.</p></li><li><p><em>How is this sustainable?</em></p><p>Server fees are currently being paid by hosting provider coupons, and from revenue by my own crypto trading on the side. I also cut down costs by only provisioning cloud resources as needed to the servers.</p></li><li><p><em>What&rsquo;s in it for you?</em></p><p>Myself, I run servers both for work and as a hobby. I started this for fun so that I could stake my own CRO and reap the full profits, but I guess it has somehow turned into a full blown venture all by itself.</p></li><li><p><em>What are the risks?</em></p><p>Servers are penaltized if they are offline for more than 4 hours, or if they were mismanaged and &ldquo;double-signed&rdquo;. Be rest assured that I take this very, very seriously and have multiple monitoring, on-call and failover tools in place to keep the nodes running smoothly.</p></li><li><p><em>Where are the servers hosted?</em></p><p>The nodes currently run on Microsoft Azure. I may move them around different cloud providers depending on pricing and availability.</p></li><li><p><em>How can I help?</em></p><p>First of all, thanks! I&rsquo;d gladly accept any loose change at <a href=https://pool.jerrychong.com/donate/>https://pool.jerrychong.com/donate/</a></p></li></ul><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-L08PSNYVSF"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag('js',new Date),gtag('config','G-L08PSNYVSF')</script><hr><footer>© 2021 Jerry Chong</footer></body></html>
