<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What is this?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jerry&rsquo;s Pool</strong> runs validator nodes several proof-of-stake Cosmos blockchains. You can stake your tokens on any validator nodes in return for staking rewards from the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Do you make any money out of this?</em></p>
<p>Nope! The commission rate of my CRO validator node is permanently set to <strong>0%</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How is this sustainable?</em></p>
<p>Server fees are fully paid for, and is mostly offset by revenue from my own crypto investments and other partnerships. I also cut down costs by only provisioning cloud resources as needed to the servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s in it for you?</em></p>
<p>Myself, I run servers both for work and as a hobby. I started this for fun so that I could stake my own CRO and reap the full profits, but I guess it has somehow turned into a full blown venture all by itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What are the risks?</em></p>
<p>Servers are penaltized if they are offline for more than 4 hours, or if they were mismanaged and &ldquo;double-signed&rdquo;. Be rest assured that I take this very, very seriously and have multiple monitoring, on-call and failover tools in place to keep the nodes running smoothly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Where are the servers hosted?</em></p>
<p>The nodes currently run on Alibaba Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Contabo. I may move them around different cloud providers depending on pricing and availability.</p>
