## Work In Progress

Some projects I am working on:

* _CRO Yield Optimizer_

  Automatically claims and reinvests staked CRO to predefined validator addresss.

* [_CRO Balancer Tracker_](https://github.com/zanglang/crypto-org-delegator-exporter)

  Given a delegator address, collect the total delegated balance.

  *NOTE:* Combined with a Prometheus setup, this will easily let us graph and calculate future APY.

* ~~_CRO Yield Visualizer_~~

  Given a delegator address, plot the profits over time and predict future gains.

  *NOTE:* Abandoned as I'm already satisfied with the balance tracker.
