## Work In Progress

Some projects I am working on:

* [_CRO Balancer Tracker_](https://github.com/zanglang/crypto-org-delegator-exporter)

  Given a delegator address, collect the total delegated balance.

  *NOTE:* Combined with a Prometheus setup, this will easily let us graph and calculate future APY.

* Yield Optimizer

  Automatically claims and restakes pending staking rewards optimally with zero risk.
