* *What is this?*

  **Jerry's Pool** is a validator node on the Crypto.org Mainnet. You can stake your CRO tokens on any validator nodes, and in return collect a 20% APR of returns from the blockchain.

* *Do you make any money out of this?*

   Nope! The commission rate of this server is permanently set to **0%**.

* *How is this sustainable?*

  Server fees are currently being paid by hosting provider coupons, and from revenue by my own crypto trading on the side. I also cut down costs by only provisioning cloud resources as needed to the servers.

* *What's in it for you?*

  Myself, I run servers both for work and as a hobby. I started this for fun so that I could stake my own CRO and reap the full profits, but I guess it has somehow turned into a full blown venture all by itself.

* *What are the risks?*

  Servers are penaltized if they are offline for more than 4 hours, or if they were mismanaged and "double-signed". Be rest assured that I take this very, very seriously and have multiple monitoring, on-call and failover tools in place to keep the nodes running smoothly.

* *Where are the servers hosted?*

  The nodes currently run on Microsoft Azure and Contabo. I may move them around different cloud providers depending on pricing and availability.

* *How can I help?*

  First of all, thanks! I'd gladly accept any loose change at https://pool.jerrychong.com/donate/
